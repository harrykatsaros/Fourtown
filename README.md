# Fourtown - Four in a Row

This project is a version of Four in a Row by Henry Galindo, Yumin Lisa Wei, Ronald Huang and Harry Katsaros. This verison of Four in a Row runs using C++ and SFML, which is library that can be downloaded here: https://www.sfml-dev.org/ 

If you are unfamiliar with SFML, the youtube video linked here was helpful to us in getting started: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neIoDQ71yb0

This project works best using Visual Studio 2022, with SFML 2.5.1 downloaded. Once the folders are downloaded as-is, simply compile the code and it should run!
